<h1>Clay Casani</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hi! I'm Clay, and I am a Business Technology major with a minor in Computer Science. I have worked with HTML and
    CSS since I was in high school for various reasons, as I have always had a huge interest in technology
    since I was extremely young. I'm not too thrilled about not implementing CSS in this project because I like to
    make things look visually appealing.</p>

<h2>In My Free Time</h2>

<p>I'm going to be upfront and say that I'm going to sit here and write about all these hobbies that I have
    because they simply don't exist. Like many people my age, I spend a lot of my free time-consuming digital content
    on platforms like TikTok. I go to the gym most days of the week, but it's not because I enjoy it but rather
    because I
    just want to look good. What I enjoy most is going to EDM events and clubs with my friends to have a good time,
    dance, and enjoy the music.</p>

<h2>Places I've Been</h2>

<p>I think I should probably start this section off by sharing where I'm from. I'm from Monmouth County, New Jersey,
    and I have nothing interesting to share about that. That being said, let's move on to some of the places I've
    traveled
    to.</p>

<dl>
    <dt>New York City</dt>
    <dd>I'm sure this one is not much of a shocker considering that I'm from New Jersey, but I'm including it
        because I think I can confidently say that it is my favorite city I've ever been to. At least within the
        US, it is hard to find another city that has as much to offer as NYC does while remaining so well-connected
    through an expansive public transit system.</dd>
    <dt>Italy</dt>
    <dd>I went to several cities in Italy including Rome, Florence, and Pisa. Florence was my favorite.</dd>
    <dt>Greece</dt>
    <dd>I also went to several places in Greece including Athens, Delphi, Kalabaka, and several of the Greek
        Islands. I was there during an extreme heat wave, landing me with a case of heat exhaustion which was not
        ideal. However, once I got over that, it didn't stop me from enjoying the beautiful islands of Mykonos,
        Santorini, and Rhodes.</dd>
    <dt>London</dt>
    <dd>If it wasn't as gloomy and rainy as it was when I was there, I think I would've loved London. It
        reminded me a lot of New York City.</dd>
